# Novel-Sorting_algorithm
This project introduces a threshold-based sorting framework that models order statistics through Boolean dominance layers. Instead of selecting by index alone, it decomposes values into vertical thresholds and integrates survival signals across them. The approach unifies weighted median, nth max and min selection under a single structural model.
