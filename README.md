Novel Sorting Algorithms via Threshold Decomposition
A Boolean Matrix Framework for Order Statistics and Selection
Overview

This repository implements a Boolean logic–based framework for sorting and order-statistic computation derived from the thesis “Novel Sorting Algorithms Using Threshold Decomposition.”

The central result of this work is that median, p-th maximum, p-th minimum, weighted median, and even full sorting can be computed using Boolean operations alone. The framework replaces direct element-to-element comparisons with threshold dominance evaluation, reformulating ordering as a structural property of logical representations rather than a positional property of numeric comparison.

Core Idea

Given a dataset

A = {a₁, a₂, …, aₙ}

For each integer threshold t, define a Boolean variable

Xᵢ(t) = 1 if aᵢ ≥ t
Xᵢ(t) = 0 otherwise

Each threshold produces a Boolean dominance row describing which elements survive that level. As the threshold increases, the number of surviving elements monotonically decreases. Conceptually stacking these rows forms a Boolean dominance matrix.

Order statistics are recovered by analyzing row-level dominance behavior. Instead of comparing elements directly, the algorithm determines where structural transitions occur in threshold space.

This reframes selection as a vertical aggregation problem across dominance layers.

Hybrid Adaptive Distinct Set (ADS) Optimization

A naive implementation would evaluate all integer thresholds from 0 to MAX, resulting in complexity proportional to N × MAX.

The Hybrid Adaptive Distinct Set optimization observes that structural transitions occur only at distinct input values. Intermediate thresholds produce identical Boolean rows and therefore contain no new information.

Let

T = {τ₁ < τ₂ < … < τᵣ}

be the sorted distinct values of the dataset. Computation is restricted to these thresholds. Each threshold is assigned an interval width

wₖ = τₖ − τₖ₋₁

This collapses redundant thresholds while preserving exact correctness.

Complexity becomes proportional to N × R, where R is the number of distinct values. For sparse datasets, this significantly reduces computational cost.

Boolean Selection Rules

At each threshold τ:

ones = number of elements ≥ τ
zeros = N − ones

Selection conditions are expressed purely as Boolean dominance rules:

Median condition:
ones > zeros

p-th maximum condition:
ones ≥ P

p-th minimum condition:
zeros < P

The final statistic is reconstructed by accumulating interval widths for thresholds satisfying the relevant rule.

Result = Σ wₖ · V(τₖ)

This produces the exact order statistic without explicit comparison operations.

Weighted Median

For weighted datasets, each element aᵢ has an associated positive weight wᵢ.

Total weight:
W_total = Σ wᵢ

The weighted median is defined as the smallest value whose cumulative weight is at least W_total / 2.

The thesis establishes that:

The weighted median reduces to the ordinary median when all weights are equal.

Weighted selection is equivalent to computing the median of a logically expanded multiset.

The Boolean threshold framework remains structurally valid in the weighted setting.

This demonstrates theoretical consistency between weighted and unweighted formulations.

Sorting via Boolean Selection

Sorting can be expressed as repeated Boolean selection:

Extract minimum (p-th minimum with P = 1)

Remove or mark the element

Repeat

Thus, full sorting becomes a sequence of Boolean dominance resolutions. This shows that ordering operations are reducible to logical aggregation rather than arithmetic comparison.

Hardware and Parallel Relevance

The framework is particularly aligned with hardware-oriented computation:

Boolean operations map directly to logic gates.

Threshold evaluations can be parallelized.

Bit-vector representations enable wide logical operations.

No complex arithmetic units are required.

In architectures emphasizing parallelism or hardware specialization, Boolean dominance evaluation can offer structural advantages.

Research Positioning

This work connects:

Order statistics theory

Threshold logic

Boolean matrix representations

Hardware-conscious algorithm design

It extends ideas historically used in median filtering and threshold logic into a generalized framework for sorting and selection.

The broader contribution is conceptual: numerical ordering can be reformulated as a logical dominance problem without loss of correctness or interpretability.
